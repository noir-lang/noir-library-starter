# noir-library-starter

This repository is a template used by the noir-lang org when creating internally maintained libraries.

This provides out of the box:

- A simple CI setup to test and format the library
- A canary flagging up compilation failures on nightly releases.
- A [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) setup to ease creating releases for the library.
- Contributing guidelines specified in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Feel free to use this template as a starting point to create your own Noir libraries.
